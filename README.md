# martinos-travel-blog-project

This was my midterm-project for the Hamburg Coding School


I'm pretty much ok with everything BUT the lightbox effect on the gallery.
I will revisit this soon.

The thing I dont like:
The pictures open as a link in the page, so there is no closing action only the browser "back" function.

Have fun exploring the page.
