the gallery:

I'm pretty much ok with everything BUT the lightbox effect on the gallery.
This is the only thing i implemented last minute with the help of tutorials stack overflow and some chatGPT, but because of lack of time I coudn't find out how to fix it.

The thing I dont like:
The pictures open as a link in the page, so there is no closing action only the browser "back" function.

the suggestion:

I think how I structured the form could be considered bad form, but it works to a certain degree.

Have fun exploring the page!
