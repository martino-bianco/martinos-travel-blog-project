          Florence is a city in Central Italy and the capital city of the
          Tuscany region. It is the most populated city in Tuscany, with 360,930
          inhabitants in 2023, and 984,991 in its metropolitan area.[4] Florence
          was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the
          wealthiest cities of that era.[5] It is considered by many
          academics[6] to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance, becoming
          a major artistic, cultural, commercial, political, economic and
          financial center.[7] During this time, Florence rose to a position of
          enormous influence in Italy, Europe, and beyond.[8] Its turbulent
          political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici
          family and numerous religious and republican revolutions.[9] From 1865
          to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. The
          Florentine dialect forms the base of Standard Italian and it became
          the language of culture throughout Italy[10] due to the prestige of
          the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio,
          Niccol√≤ Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini. The city attracts
          millions of tourists each year, and UNESCO declared the Historic
          Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is noted
          for its culture, Renaissance art and architecture and monuments.[11]
          The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries, such as the
          Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti, and still exerts an influence in
          the fields of art, culture and politics.
